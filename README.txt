How to use:
	The game takes input entirely from the keyboard. The main menu (which you are greeted by when you run the program) lists the things you can do/view with corresponding keys (1-4). Press 1 while on the main menu to learn how to play. Use 'b' to navigate back from the leaderboard/how to play screen to the main menu.
	
	Before playing (pressing 2 or 3 on the main menu) read the how to play. The game is pretty easy to learn.
